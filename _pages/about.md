I am a research scientist at [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) working on Deep Generative Models.
I have a Ph.D in applied mathematics and machine learning focusing on generative models at INRIA. In particular, I worked on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and was mostly interested in providing interesting and relevant modellings of their latent space. I also maintain Python libraries trying to democratize those models. Find more on [github](https://github.com/clementchadebec).
